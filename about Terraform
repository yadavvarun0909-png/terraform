Terraform is a tool that creates and manages cloud resources automatically

Instead of clicking in AWS, you write code
 Terraform reads the code and creates servers, networks, databases

Using Terraform, you can create:
EC2 instances
VPC, Subnets
Security Groups
Load Balancers
RDS databases
EKS (Kubernetes)
S3 buckets

| Command             | Meaning                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `terraform init`    | Prepare Terraform         |
| `terraform plan`    | Show what will be created |
| `terraform apply`   | Create infrastructure     |
| `terraform destroy` | Delete everything         |

Without Terraform:-------------
Manually create EC2
Manually create VPC
Manually create Security Group
Easy to make mistakes
Hard to repeat the same setup


With Terraform:---------------
Write code once
Run one command
Everything is created automatically
Same setup every time
